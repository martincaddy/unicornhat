# unicornhat
Examples of code used with the unicorn hat on Raspberry Pi.
Recently acquired a Unicornhat
I've experiemnted with some basic images from the paint program
The images can then display on input with some effects like flashing or glow and fade.
All very basic but i'm enjoying developing it.
